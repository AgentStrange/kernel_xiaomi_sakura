	bool "MSM Memory Dump Support"
	help
	  This enables memory dump feature. It allows various client
	  subsystems to register respective dump regions. At the time
	  of deadlocks or cpu hangs these dump regions are captured to
	  give a snapshot of the system at the time of the crash.

	 Use this to report msm boot stats such as bootloader throughput,
	 display init, total boot time.
	 This figures are reported in mpm sleep clock cycles and have a
	 resolution of 31 bits as 1 bit is used as an overflow check.

config MSM_WATCHDOG_V2
	bool "MSM Watchdog Support"
	help
	  This enables the watchdog module. It causes kernel panic if the
	  watchdog times out. It allows for detection of cpu hangs and
	  deadlocks. It does not run during the bootup process, so it will
	  not catch any early lockups.
