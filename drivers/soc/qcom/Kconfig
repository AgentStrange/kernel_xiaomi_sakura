config QCOM_GSBI
        tristate "QCOM General Serial Bus Interface"
        depends on ARCH_QCOM
        help
          Say y here to enable GSBI support.  The GSBI provides control
          functions for connecting the underlying serial UART, SPI, and I2C
          devices to the output pins.

config MSM_MEMORY_DUMP
	bool "MSM Memory Dump Support"
	help
	  This enables memory dump feature. It allows various client
	  subsystems to register respective dump regions. At the time
	  of deadlocks or cpu hangs these dump regions are captured to
	  give a snapshot of the system at the time of the crash.

config MSM_MEMORY_DUMP_V2
	bool "MSM Memory Dump V2 Support"
	help
	  This enables memory dump feature. It allows various client
	  subsystems to register respective dump regions. At the time
	  of deadlocks or cpu hangs these dump regions are captured to
	  give a snapshot of the system at the time of the crash.

config MSM_DEBUG_LAR_UNLOCK
	bool "MSM Debug LAR Unlock Support"
	depends on MSM_MEMORY_DUMP_V2
	help
	 This allows unlocking Core Debug lock to allow capture
	 of upper 32 bits of program counter at the time of
	 system crash. This is useful in getting correct crash
	 location.

config MSM_BOOT_STATS
	bool "Use MSM boot stats reporting"
	help
	 Use this to report msm boot stats such as bootloader throughput,
	 display init, total boot time.
	 This figures are reported in mpm sleep clock cycles and have a
	 resolution of 31 bits as 1 bit is used as an overflow check.

config MSM_CPUSS_DUMP
	bool "CPU Subsystem Dumping support"
	help
	 Add support to dump various hardware entities such as the instruction
	 and data tlb's as well as the unified tlb, which are a part of the
	 cpu subsystem to an allocated buffer. This allows for analysis of the
	 the entities if corruption is suspected.
	 If unsure, say N

config MSM_WATCHDOG_V2
	bool "MSM Watchdog Support"
	help
	  This enables the watchdog module. It causes kernel panic if the
	  watchdog times out. It allows for detection of cpu hangs and
	  deadlocks. It does not run during the bootup process, so it will
	  not catch any early lockups.

config MSM_FORCE_WDOG_BITE_ON_PANIC
	bool "MSM force watchdog bite"
	depends on MSM_WATCHDOG_V2
	help
	  This forces a watchdog bite when the device restarts due to a
	  kernel panic. On certain MSM SoCs, this provides us
	  additional debugging information.

config MSM_CPU_PWR_CTL
	bool "Cpu subsystem power control"
	depends on SMP && (ARM || ARM64)
	default y
	help
	Provides routines to power on cpu rails and l2 cache
	controller during coldboot.

config MSM_CACHE_M4M_ERP64
       bool "Cache and M4M error report"
       depends on ARCH_MSM8996
       help
         Say 'Y' here to enable reporting of cache and M4M errors to the kernel
         log. The kernel log contains collected error syndrome and address
         registers. These register dumps can be used as useful information
         to find out possible hardware problems.

config MSM_CACHE_M4M_ERP64_PANIC_ON_CE
       bool "Panic on correctable cache/M4M errors"
       help
         Say 'Y' here to cause kernel panic when correctable cache/M4M errors
         are detected.  Enabling this is useful when you want to dump memory
         and system state close to the time when the error occured.

          If unsure, say N.

config MSM_CACHE_M4M_ERP64_PANIC_ON_UE
       bool "Panic on uncorrectable cache/M4M errors"
       help
         Say 'Y' here to cause kernel panic when uncorrectable cache/M4M errors
         are detected.

config MSM_RPM_SMD
	bool "RPM driver using SMD protocol"
	help
	  RPM is the dedicated hardware engine for managing shared SoC
	  resources. This config adds driver support for using SMD as a
	  transport layer communication with RPM hardware. It also selects
	  the MSM_MPM config that programs the MPM module to monitor interrupts
	  during sleep modes.

config MSM_SCM
       bool "Secure Channel Manager (SCM) support"
       default n

config MSM_MPM_OF
       bool "Modem Power Manager"
       depends on OF
       help
        MPM is a dedicated hardware resource responsible for entering and
        waking up from a system wide low power mode. The MPM driver tracks
        the wakeup interrupts and configures the MPM to monitor the wakeup
        interrupts when going to a system wide sleep mode. This config option
        enables the MPM driver that supports initialization from a device
        tree
