* QBT1000 (Qualcomm Technologies Inc Ultra-Sonic Fingerprint Sensor)

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "qcom,qbt1000"
- clock-names : List of clock names that need to be voted on/off
- clocks : Property pair that represents the clock controller and the clock
           id. This in combimination with the clock-name is used to obtain
           the handle for the clock that needs to be voted on/off
- clock-frequency : Frequency of clock in Hz

Example:
        qcom,qbt1000 {
                compatible = "qcom,qbt1000";
                clock-names = "spi_clk", "ahb_clk";
                clocks = <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_blsp1_qup5_spi_apps_clk>,
                         <&clock_gcc clk_gcc_blsp1_ahb_clk>;
                clock-frequency = <15000000>;
        };
