Limits Management Hardware Driver
================================
LMH driver provides API to interact with the LMH hardware. All the calls to
the LMH hardware are routed via secure space.

The device tree parameters for LMH driver are:

Device/Asic specific properties:
- reg : Base address of the LMH Lite hardware's interrupt status register
		and its size in bytes.  'reg' parameter is required if
		'qcom,lmh-trim-err-offset' is set.
- qcom,lmh-trim-err-offset : This property defines the bit in the LMH
		interrupt status register, which shows whether there is a
		trim error in LMH hardware.
- vdd-apss-supply : This property should hold the phandle of APSS regulator.
		When defined, the M4M DPM will be notified for the APSS
		voltage change.

Required parameters:
- compatible: Must be either "qcom,lmh" or "qcom,lmh_v1".
		The driver based on the compatible string will decide
		the default profile.
- interrupts: LMH Lite hardware interrupt details.

Example:

qcom,lmh {
	compatible = "qcom,lmh";
	interrupts = <0 332 4>;
	reg = <0xF9117000 0x4>;
	qcom,lmh-trim-err-offset = <18>;
	vdd-apss-supply = <&pm8994_s11>;
};

Or for asics that don't have trim err and don't require the voltage change
update for DPM.

qcom,lmh {
	compatible = "qcom,lmh_v1";
	interrupts = <0 332 4>;
};
